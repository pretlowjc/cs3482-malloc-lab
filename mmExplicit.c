* In addition, the heap is organized in the following way:
*
* begin                                                          end

* |  pad   | hdr(8/1) | ftr(8/1) | zero or more usr blks | hdr(0/1) |
*  -----------------------------------------------------------------
*          |       prologue      |                       | epilogue |
*          |         block       |                       | block    |
*
* The allocated prologue and epilogue blocks are overhead that
* eliminate edge conditions during coalescing.
*
* The code targets an X86 32-bit machine, which means double word
* alignment.  Each block is a multiple of 8 bytes in size and the
* address of the payload is a multiple of 8.  Headers and footers
* are 4 bytes each.
